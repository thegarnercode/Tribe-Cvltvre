+Products.jsx+
{products.map((produtcs)=>(
    <Grid item key={product.id} xs={12} sm={6} md={4} lg={3}>
    
))}

- above is how you map through items
whenever looking through items
in jsx the items need to have an id

xs,sm,md & lg are the width the grid is going to take on different devices
___________________
+Product.jsx+
product.jsx is a sub-component/child component of Products.jsx
so in Product.jsx we call our products from Products.jsx

* below you destructure the product from the props using the curly braces
const Product = ({ product }) => {
}

in Product.jsx we create our Mocks first , meaning
we import our card content to display our products
we will need to import React from React
import card, card content, card media, card actions, typography, & IconButton

import classes that are coming from styles.js file
__________________
+Styles.js+
the only goal of this file is to say export default to export the call to function makeStyles
function makeStyles takes in 1 parameter and that is yet another callback function inside of there with an instant return 
with instant returns we wrap it in parenthesis and return an object

inside of object we will write our styles in css/js type of way
